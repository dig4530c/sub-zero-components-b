						<li><h3>Shipping Policy</h3></li>
						<li>
							<div>Welcome to our shipping policy. We are currently shipping to:</div>
							<div>United States (48 contiguous United States)</div>
							<p>
								We strive to get your products to you as quickly as possible. 
								The cost for shipping is only $7.95 for your entire order in the 48 contiguous United States. 
								We do not offer express shipping at this time. Most orders are shipped the next business day after 
								they are placed. We use UPS ground shipping for all orders in the continental US. Orders arrive 
								within 5-7 business days.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Shipping Procedures</h4>
							<p>
								We will send you a shipping confirmation email when all or part of your order is shipped.   
								This email is sent after the first UPS scan.  The email will include the UPS tracking number.  
								You will be sent a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number for every shipment.  
								You can check the status of your order anytime by clicking  Order Status link in the top header of 
								the site.
							</p>
							<p>
								If your order includes several items, they may ship separately and at different times. So that we 
								can deliver your purchases to you as efficiently as possible, items which ship from the same location 
								are grouped together. Our shipping confirmation emails will let you know how much of your order has 
								shipped.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Delivering Your Package</h4>
							<p>
								We process, ship, and deliver packages Monday through Friday. At this time, we do not offer shipping 
								or delivery on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays. Your order may be delayed if your shipping address is 
								different from your billing address (we use this additional time to help ensure the security of your 
								credit information). Most items are available to ship in 1-2 business days unless otherwise noted.
							</p>

						<li>
							<p>
								All of your purchases at SubZero Components are covered by our 30-day unconditional money-back 
								guarantee. Please note: only one opened package of any product is eligible for return. All others 
								of the same product must be in its original factory-sealed container for refund. 
							</p>                    
							<p>
								To return an item, please contact our customer service department by e-mail or for a Return 
								Authorization Number and return instructions. Please note: You must have a valid Return Authorization 
								Number prior to returning any merchandise. 
							</p>                    
							<p>
								If your item is damaged or defective please contact us by e-mail. Please be sure to include your order 
								or invoice number in the e-mail, and explain the situation. Examples of damaged items are broken glass, 
								cracked plastic bottles, safety seal removed or torn off, and bottles leaking. Dented bottles or 
								packages are most often not considered damaged because this does not take away from the safety or 
								potency of the product inside. 
							</p>                    
							<p>
								If for any reason you are unhappy with any product you have purchased from us, you may return it for a 
								full refund (less shipping and handling). Only one opened package of any product is eligible for return. 
								All others of the same product must be in a factory sealed container for refund. You are covered by 
								this unconditional money-back guarantee for a full 30 days from your date of purchase. Please contact 
								us by e-mail within 30 days of the shipment date to receive authorization and return instructions.

						<li><h3>Privacy Policy</h3></li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of SubZero Components 
								LLC, doing business as SubZero Components (“we” or “us” or “The Site”). Specifically, it outlines the 
								types of information that we gather and how we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our 
								children’s privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may 
								collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through 
								the mail).
							</p>                    
							<p>
								Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. 
								By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, 
								is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our 
								Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we’ll post the changes to this Privacy Policy 
								on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By 
								continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
							</p>                    
							
								<h4>How We Collect and Use Information</h4>
							<p>
								We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while 
								using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). 
								We only contact individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed 
								up to receive our free newsletters or have purchased one of our products. We only collect personally 
								identifying information from our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally, 
								this information includes name and e-mail address for registration to receive our free newsletters and 
								name, postal address, and credit card information when purchasing our products. All of this information 
								is provided to us by you.
							</p>                    
							<p>
								We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the 
								Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which 
								allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on 
								the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your 
								experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for 
								record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver 
								advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also 
								prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have 
								entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files 
								also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML- 
								formatted email messages.
							</p>                    
							<p>
								We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including 
								using the information to customize features and advertising that appear on the Site. We also may provide 
								your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors, and advertisers, for a 
								variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the 
								right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you while 
								you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide 
								you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used for 
								these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the 
								end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these 
								purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties.
							</p>					
							<p>
								Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by 
								third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas – that 
								information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any 
								unauthorized third-party use of such information.
							</p>					
							<p>
								Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also 
								may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party 
								advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to 
								help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and 
								collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the 
								relevant third-party’s.
							</p>					
							<p>
								Advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party’s 
								use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party’s website and 
								review its privacy policy.
							</p>					
							<p>
								The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered by 
								third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase 
								third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the 
								privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.
								We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site through cooperative 
								relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in 
								connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any 
								information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made 
								available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect 
								information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to 
								the provider partner’s use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ 
								from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you 
								should contact the provider partner directly for more information.
							</p>					
							<p>
								Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to 
								comply with law or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.
								Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event 
								that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another company, 
								information about our users may be among the transferred assets.
